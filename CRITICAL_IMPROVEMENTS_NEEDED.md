## üö® **TIER 1: CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED**

### 1. **PDF Export Isolation Issue** ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNRESOLVED**
```javascript
// CURRENT PROBLEM:
Error: "this.doc.autoTable is not a function"
Status: Import fixed but needs live testing verification

// REQUIRED ACTION:
‚úÖ Fixed import: import autoTable from 'jspdf-autotable';
‚ùå NOT TESTED: Live browser verification needed
‚ùå NOT CONFIRMED: Isolations actually appearing in PDF
```
**Impact**: Users cannot export meeting data to PDF - core functionality broken
**Timeline**: **IMMEDIATE** - Must test and verify fix works

### 2. **SharePoint 2016 Compatibility Issues** üî¥
```javascript
// COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS:
- IE 11 support not verified
- Edge Legacy compatibility unknown

// NEEDED:
‚ùå File upload progress bars
‚ùå Export generation progress
‚ùå Processing status indicators
‚ùå Cancel operation buttons
```

---

## üîí **TIER 4: SECURITY & COMPLIANCE GAPS**

### 9. **Input Validation Weaknesses** üü†
```javascript
// SECURITY CONCERNS:
- File upload validation insufficient
- No malware scanning
- Large file handling issues
- Memory exhaustion possible

// REQUIRED HARDENING:
‚ùå File type validation
‚ùå File size limits
‚ùå Malware scanning integration
‚ùå Memory usage monitoring
```

### 10. **Audit Trail Incomplete** üü†
```javascript
// COMPLIANCE GAPS:
- No user action logging
- No data change tracking
- No export audit trail
- No access control logging
