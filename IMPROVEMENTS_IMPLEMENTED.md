## ✅ TIER 1 CRITICAL FIXES - COMPLETED

### 1. **PDF Export Implementation - FIXED** 🔧
**Problem**: `autoTable is not a function` error breaking PDF generation
**Solution**: 
```javascript
// Before (broken):
import autoTable from 'jspdf-autotable';

- ✅ Enhanced error handling with graceful fallback
- ✅ Removed production console.log statements
- ✅ Added development-only logging with environment checks

### 2. **Architecture Issues Resolution - FIXED** 🏗️
**Problem**: Duplicate context providers and theme handling confusion
**Solutions**:
- ✅ **Context Provider Duplication**: Removed from App.jsx, kept centralized in index.jsx
- ✅ **Theme Handling**: Standardized in index.jsx with proper Material-UI integration
- ✅ **localStorage Migration**: Fixed key inconsistencies with backward compatibility
- ✅ **Error Context**: Enhanced context with loading states and error handling

### 3. **Environment Configuration - FIXED** ⚙️
**Problem**: Port mismatches and missing environment configuration
**Solutions**:
- ✅ **Backend .env.example**: Comprehensive environment template created
- ✅ **Frontend .env.example**: Feature flags and configuration template
- ✅ **CORS Configuration**: Flexible multi-origin support for different environments
- ✅ **API Client**: Centralized API communication with proper error handling

### 4. **Security Vulnerabilities - SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED** 🔒
**Problem**: 15 security vulnerabilities (3 low, 3 moderate, 8 high, 1 critical)
**Results**:
- ✅ **Reduced to 10 vulnerabilities** (3 moderate, 7 high - no critical remaining)
- ✅ **Fixed Critical Issues**: form-data, jspdf, brace-expansion, on-headers
- ✅ **Security Framework**: Comprehensive security utility created
- ✅ **Vulnerability Documentation**: SECURITY_RECOMMENDATIONS.md created
