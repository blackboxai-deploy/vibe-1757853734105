- **Parts Comments** (vendor info, lead time, alternatives)

### **3. Equipment Disconnection/Removal Assessment**
- **Does Equipment Need to be Disconnected?** (Yes/No/Partially)
- **Does Equipment Need to be Removed?** (Yes/No/Temporarily)
- **Disconnection/Removal Comments** (complexity, resources needed, timeline)

### **4. Risk Assessment (WMS Manual Compliance)**
- **Overall Risk Level** (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- **Corrosion Risk** (Low/Medium/High/N/A)

- **Business Impact** (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

### **5. Support & Resources**
- **Support Required?** (Yes/No/Scheduled)
- **Type of Support** (Contractor/Maintenance/Engineering/Operations)
- **Support Comments** (who, when, what type)

### **6. Timeline & Planning**
- **Planned Resolution Date** (target date)
- **Work Window Required?** (Yes/No/Shutdown Only)
- **Priority Level** (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

### **7. Action Items & Next Steps**
- **Action Required?** (None/Monitor/Plan Work/Urgent)
- **Action Items** (list with owners and due dates)
- **Next Review Date** (when to review again)

## üéØ **CURRENT QUESTIONNAIRE ANALYSIS**

### ‚úÖ **Currently Implemented (Good)**
- Risk Level Assessment ‚úÖ
- MOC Required & Number ‚úÖ
- WMS Manual Risk Assessment (Corrosion, Dead Legs, Automation) ‚úÖ
- Action Required ‚úÖ
- Comments Section ‚úÖ
- Action Items with Owners ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå **Missing Critical Questions**
- **Parts Assessment** (missing completely)
- **Equipment Disconnection/Removal** (missing)
- **Timeline Planning** (missing planned resolution date)
- **Support Requirements** (partially implemented)
- **Work Window Requirements** (missing)
- **Parts Expected Arrival Date** (missing)

### üîß **Needs Improvement**
- **Parts Required**: Currently only Yes/No, needs status tracking
- **Support Required**: Too generic, needs type specification
- **Timeline**: No planned resolution date field
- **Priority**: Present but could be more structured

## üö® **PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED**

### **1. Add Parts Management Section**
```javascript
// Missing fields that need to be added:
partsRequired: 'Yes/No/Unknown',
partsDescription: '',
partsExpectedDate: '',
partsStatus: 'Not Ordered/Ordered/In Transit/Available/Installed',
partsComments: ''
```

### **2. Add Equipment Management Section**
```javascript
// Missing fields:
equipmentDisconnectionRequired: 'Yes/No/Partially',
equipmentRemovalRequired: 'Yes/No/Temporarily', 
disconnectionComments: ''
```

### **3. Add Timeline Management**
```javascript
// Missing fields:
plannedResolutionDate: '',
workWindowRequired: 'Yes/No/Shutdown Only',
priorityLevel: 'Low/Medium/High/Critical'
```

### **4. Enhance Support Assessment**
```javascript
// Improve existing:
supportRequired: 'Yes/No/Scheduled',
supportType: 'Contractor/Maintenance/Engineering/Operations/Multiple',
supportComments: ''
```

## üéØ **IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **High Priority Additions**
1. **Parts Expected Arrival Date** - Critical for planning
2. **Equipment Disconnection Questions** - Essential for risk assessment
3. **Planned Resolution Date** - Required for project management
4. **Work Window Requirements** - Critical for scheduling

### **Medium Priority Enhancements**
1. **Parts Status Tracking** - Better visibility
2. **Support Type Specification** - More precise resource planning
3. **Enhanced Priority Levels** - Better decision making

### **User Experience Improvements**
1. **Conditional Field Display** - Only show relevant fields
2. **Better Field Organization** - Group related questions
3. **Validation Rules** - Ensure data quality
4. **Help Text** - Guidance for each question

## üîç **INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES**

### **Oil & Gas Industry Standards**
- Parts availability tracking is mandatory
- Equipment disconnection assessment required
- Timeline planning with realistic dates
- Risk-based prioritization system

### **WMS Manual Compliance**
- Periodic risk assessment (Corrosion, Dead Legs, Automation)
- 6-month Asset Manager review escalation
- Documented justification for long-term isolations
- Action-oriented follow-up system

### **Project Management Best Practices**
- Clear ownership assignment
- Realistic timeline expectations
- Dependencies tracking (parts, support, windows)
- Regular review cycles

## üìä **EXPECTED BENEFITS OF IMPROVEMENTS**

1. **Better Planning**: Parts arrival dates enable better scheduling
2. **Risk Reduction**: Equipment questions identify safety concerns
3. **Resource Optimization**: Support type classification improves allocation
4. **Timeline Management**: Resolution dates improve project tracking
5. **Compliance**: Industry standard questions ensure regulatory compliance
